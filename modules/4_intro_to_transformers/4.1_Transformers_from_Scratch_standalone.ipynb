This is more training-efficient (because there are fewer parameters in our model), and it might seem pricipled at first. after all, if two words have very similar meanings, shouldn't they have similar embedding vectors because the model will treat them the same, and similar unembedding vectors because they could both be substituted for each other in most output?\n",

In other words, rather than sampling tokens from each sequence by taking `logprobs.topk(k)` in your `generate` method, you should take the `k` top tokens after filtering out those that give you repeated n-grams of length `no_repeat_ngram_size`. good values of this parameter to try are 2 or 3 (although we recommend you try without this parameter first, so you can see how much of a difference it makes!)."
